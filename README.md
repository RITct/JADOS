JADOS (Just Another Disk Operating System)

This is an MSDOS style OS. It is written entirely in Assembly - NASM. It is meant for x86 Real Mode (16-bit). It supports FAT12 file-system.  

It started as the undergrad mini-project for a 3 man team comprising of myself and 2 other friends. Our goal was to get familiar with bare-metal programming, bootloaders and basics of OS.

Later we decided to convert this into a reference for people who fancy learning how OSes worked in the DOS era. It can serve as a userful learning resource for people who are getting started with Bootstrap loaders, x86 Real-Mode programming, Assembly programming, etc.
